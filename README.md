# Posture-detection-using-PoseNet

This project aims to detect posture using the p5.js and ml5.js libraries. The application can be run in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and provides real-time posture detection capabilities.

### Overview
The project utilizes the following libraries:

**p5.js:** A JavaScript library for creative coding and visualization. It provides an easy-to-use framework for creating interactive graphics and animations.

**ml5.js:** A machine learning library built on top of TensorFlow.js. It simplifies the integration of pre-trained machine learning models into JavaScript applications.

The posture detection algorithm in this project utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model called PoseNet, which can estimate the human pose based on input from a webcam.

**Features**
- Real-time posture detection using webcam input.
- Display of estimated keypoints representing body joints and skeleton.

**Usage**
- Grant permission to access your webcam when prompted by the browser.
- Stand in front of the webcam with your whole body visible.
- The application will start detecting your posture and display the estimated keypoints and skeleton.
